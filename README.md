A python utillity package for working with fasta sequences.

A total of XX utilities/options for working with fasta sequences are organized under yy main commands. The utilities ranges from searching specific sequence entries from a large set of fasta sequences based on ID or a text string in the defline or a sequence motif to spliting a large sequence file into small chuncks, reporting summary stats of a genome assembly and display sequences in reverse complementary. It allows input from and output to stdout, therefore multiple processes can be done via use of pile (|).
